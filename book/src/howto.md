# How to use failure

This section of the documentation is about how the APIs exposed in failure can
be used. It is organized around the major APIs of failure:

- **[The Fail trait](./fail.html):** The primary abstraction provided by failure.
- **[Deriving Fail](./derive-fail.html):** A custom derive for the Fail trait.
- **[The Error type](./error.html):** A convenient wrapper around any Fail type.
